# Movies-ETL

## Overview of Election Audit:
We have developed and implemented ETL processes to prepare data for a hackathon.  We gathered, combined, and cleaned data from Wikipedia and Kaggle in order to form a workable dataset.

Now, we plan to automate this pipeline, taking, transforming, and loading data into existing tables.

## The Tasks
* In Deliverable 1, we develop a function for automatically extracting and reading our desired files.
* In Deliverable 2, we add code and functions to clean most of the data- the Wikipedia set.
* In Deliverable 3, we expand on this, adding code to clean and merge Kaggle data to this set.
* In Deliverable 4, we automate the process of exporting the desired dataframes into a PostgreSQL database.
